# Pipeline Description

1. **Checkout Code:** CircleCI first checks out your code from your chosen repository. This step ensures that CircleCI has access to the latest code updates.
2. **Setup Environment:** Next, CircleCI sets up the environment necessary for running your code. This includes installing any required dependencies or packages.
3. **Build:** The build step involves compiling your code and creating any necessary artifacts or executables.
4. **Test:** Once your code is built, CircleCI runs any tests that you have defined in your project. If any of the tests fail, the pipeline stops here and notifies you of the failure.
5. **Deploy:** If all tests pass, CircleCI deploys your code to your desired environment, such as a production server or staging environment.
